This repository contains my hands-on C# and .NET exercises as I work through Microsoft Learn content. Projects are organized by topic in separate folders to help reinforce key concepts through practice.

## üìÇ Structure

* **Basics/** (conditionals, loops, operators, strings, I/O, etc.)
* **Intermediate/** (enums, exception handling, structs, switch expressions, method arguments, etc.)
* **Advanced/** (named/optional arguments, params keyword, extension methods, generics, nullable types, record types, async/await, custom exceptions)
* **Arrays and Collections/** (arrays, lists, dictionaries, queues, stacks, and more)
* **OOP/** (classes, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, method overloading, namespaces, project examples)

Each folder holds one or more console applications or code samples focused on the named topic. Explore any folder and run the contained project(s) with `dotnet run`.
